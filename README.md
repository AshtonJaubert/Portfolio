# Ashton Jaubert's Data Analytics Porfolio
Hello! This Repository contains a list of Data Analytics related projects I've worked on from different Programs such as SQL,Python and Tableau. If you have any questions or feedback I will be happy to answer them on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashtonjaubert/).

# Featured Projects:

## Card Transaction EDA
In this Project I used Python to find spending patterns from over 50k tranactions across different Genders,Categories and States and created a interactive dashboard on Tableau to showcase insights found.

## Housing Loan Approval Prediction(Classification)
In This Machine Learning Project I will be working with a Housing Loan dataset that has features such as # of Depenednts, Credit Score, loan amount ,etc to depict whether or not the person will be approved for the loan they applied to. I created several models to determine the best model to use to predict whether or not the person will get approved of the loan.

The dataset used for this was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset/data)
