# Ashton Jaubert's Data Analytics Porfolio
Hello! This Repository contains a list of Data Analytics related projects I've worked on from different Programs such as SQL,Python and Tableau. If you have any questions or feedback I will be happy to answer them on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashtonjaubert/).

# Featured Projects:

## Card Transaction EDA
In this Project I used Python to find spending patterns from over 50k tranactions across different Genders,Categories and States and created a interactive dashboard on Tableau to showcase insights found.

The dataset used for this project was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatsurana979/comprehensive-credit-card-transactions-dataset/data)

U can find the ipynb file and Dashboard Here: [Ipymb](https://github.com/AshtonJaubert/Portfolio/blob/main/CardTransactions.ipynb) [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashton.jaubert/viz/TransactionDataAnalysis_17097954017460/Dashboard1)
#### Libaries used: 
- Pandas
- numPy 
- Seaborn 
- Matplotlib

## Balance Of Trade SQL
In this SQL Project I created sub queries from the data of the Imports and Exports from over 100 Countries from 1960-2021 to answer specific questions asked about the data.

Used aggregate functions such as SUM,AVG,MAX to locate export and import patterns and compare countries from one another.
 


Dataset Used for this Project can be found on [OurWorldinData.org](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth)

SQL Script from Project: [BalanceOfTrade](https://github.com/AshtonJaubert/Portfolio/blob/main/Imports%26Exports.sql)
#### RDBMS Used:
- MySQL
 


## Housing Loan Approval Prediction(Classification)
In This Machine Learning Project I will be working with a Housing Loan dataset that has features such as # of Depenedents, Credit Score, loan amount ,etc to depict whether or not the person will be approved for the loan they applied to. 

Created several models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest etc, to determine the best model to use to predict whether or not the person will get approved of the loan. â€¢
 
Developed an XGBoost and Random Forest model with accuracy scores of 98%+


The dataset used for this was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset/data)

U can find the ipymb file for this project here: [ipynb](https://github.com/AshtonJaubert/Portfolio/blob/main/LoanApproval.ipynb)
#### Libraries used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- XGBoost
## Global GDP Tableau Dashboard

- Created an Interactive Dashboard from Tableau to show GDP values of different countries from 1950-2019 

- Provided filter tabs of Yearly and Country Values to see the total GDP of the Country from 1950-2019 or In specific Years

- Allows Users to see how the GDP of countries  fluctuates from year to year and who led the globe in total GDP from each year.


This Dashboard as well as my other dashboards I have created are seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/G78HPBJ2X?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
