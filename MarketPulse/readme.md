MarketPulse: Serverless Financial Sentiment APIMarketPulse is a lightweight, cloud-native API that provides real-time sentiment analysis for stock tickers. Instead of relying on delayed or expensive financial data feeds, it scrapes the latest news headlines directly from FinViz and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate immediate "Bullish" or "Bearish" trading signals.Built with FastAPI, Docker, and NLTK, and designed for serverless deployment on AWS Lambda.🚀 FeaturesReal-Time Data Extraction: Custom-built scraper using BeautifulSoup and Requests to bypass unreliable third-party APIs.NLP-Driven Insights: Utilizes the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model to detect market sentiment from unstructured text.Statistically Significant Sampling: Analyzes the latest 30 headlines to balance statistical relevance with recency bias (avoiding stale news).Serverless Architecture: Wrapped with Mangum adapter and containerized with Docker, making it strictly compatible with AWS Lambda.🛠️ Tech StackFramework: Python 3.11, FastAPIData Acquisition: Requests, BeautifulSoup4 (Web Scraping)Machine Learning: NLTK (VADER Sentiment Analysis)Deployment: Docker, AWS Lambda, Mangum (ASGI Adapter)⚡ Quick Start (Local)PrerequisitesPython 3.11+Docker (Optional, for container testing)1. InstallationClone the repository and install dependencies.pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the APIStart the local server using Uvicorn.python main.py
3. UsageSend a GET request to analyze a specific ticker (e.g., NVIDIA).Endpoint:GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze/{ticker}Example Request:http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze/NVDAExample Response:{
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "sentiment_score": 0.1245,
    "sentiment_label": "Bullish",
    "headlines_analyzed": 30
}
🧠 Engineering DecisionsWhy Web Scraping instead of yfinance?During development, the yfinance library proved unstable due to upstream API changes and compilation issues on macOS (curl_cffi). I pivoted to a custom scraping solution using BeautifulSoup targeting FinViz. This ensures higher reliability and removes dependency on third-party wrapper libraries that frequently break.Why N=30 Headlines?I selected a sample size of 30 headlines based on the Central Limit Theorem.< 10: Too volatile; a single misclassified headline skews the score.> 50: Introduces "Time Bias," pulling in news from weeks ago that is no longer relevant to current price action.30: The statistical sweet spot for stability while maintaining a 48-72 hour recency window for active stocks.Sentiment ThresholdingFinancial news is inherently "dry" and professional, often lacking the emotional intensity VADER expects from social media. Therefore, I adjusted the sentiment threshold to ±0.05 to capture subtle shifts in market tone, rather than waiting for extreme emotional outliers.🐳 Docker DeploymentThe project includes a Dockerfile optimized for AWS Lambda.# Build the image
docker build -t marketpulse .

# Run locally (Port 9000 mapped to 8080)
docker run -p 9000:8080 marketpulse
🔮 Future RoadmapCI/CD Pipeline: Automate deployment to AWS ECR using GitHub Actions.Cloud Hosting: Deploy to AWS Lambda with an API Gateway trigger.Tiered Sentiment: Implement "Strong Bullish" (>0.15) vs "Bullish" (>0.05) classifications.
